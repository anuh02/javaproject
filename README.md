# Data Structure and Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview

**Data Structure and Algorithm Visualizer** is a Java-based tool designed to provide an intuitive and interactive way to understand common data structures and algorithms. This project was developed as part of a group assignment during our undergraduate studies to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation.
