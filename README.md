# Data Structure and Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview

**Data Structure and Algorithm Visualizer** is a Java-based tool designed to provide an intuitive and interactive way to understand common data structures and algorithms. This project was developed as part of a group assignment during our undergraduate studies to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation.

## Features

### Data Structures
- **Stack**: Visualizes stack operations like push, pop, and peek.
- **Queue**: Demonstrates enqueue and dequeue operations.
- **Array**: Showcases dynamic updates and traversals.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Illustrates insertion, search, and traversal operations.

### Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort**: Step-by-step visualization of the bubble sort algorithm.
- **Insertion Sort**: Animates the process of building a sorted sequence.
- **Selection Sort**: Highlights the process of finding the minimum element and swapping.
- **Merge Sort**: Provides a clear visual of the divide-and-conquer approach.

### Graph Algorithms
- **Depth First Search (DFS)**: Visualizes recursive and iterative graph traversal.
- **Breadth First Search (BFS)**: Demonstrates level-order graph traversal.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Animates finding the shortest path in weighted graphs.

### Search Algorithms
- **Linear Search**: Step-by-step illustration of searching through an array.
- **Binary Search**: Efficient search on sorted data visualized in action.
